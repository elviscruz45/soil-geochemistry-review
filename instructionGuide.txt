General descriptions on what the code does to inputted data. Cleaning steps can be tweaked based on what the input data set has or is lacking. Parameter choice can also be modified based on the user.

correlatedFeatures.py reads the inputted data and calculates Pearson correlation coefficients for all pairs of features. It also test this correlation for various runs of a train-test split to compare how this randomness impacts correlation of features.

pipelineTopography.py reads the inputted data and creates two datasets: one with topographic data one without. Then it runs nine machine learning algorithms and compares performance with and without topographic data, which are the .csv outputs.

pipelineSamplingMethod.py reads the inputted data and compares performance of using six different sampling methods across nine machine learning algorithms. Results of performance are outputted in .csv files.

pipelineMCS.py reads the inputted data and trains nine machine learning algorithms, which are used in the paper. Then it creates multiple classifier systems based on 5 architectures. Results are outputted in .csv files.
